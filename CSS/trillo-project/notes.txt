Flexbox is a new module that makes it easy to align elements 
to one another, in different directions and orders.
The main idea behind flexbox is to give the container the ability 
to expand and to shrink elements.
Less and more readable and logical code. 


The main area in flex is flex container in which we have flex items.
The x-axis is main axis and y-axis is cross axis
We can access flexbox by setting display: flex;
