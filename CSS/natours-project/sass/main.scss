//Responsive Design
//1. Fluid grids and layouts- to allow content to easily adapt to the current viewport width used
//to browse the website. Uses % rather than px for all layout-related lengths

//2. Flexible/Responsive images- Images behave differently than text content, and so we need to ensure that
//they also adapt nicely to the current viewport

//3. Media queries- To change styles on certain viewport widths(breakpoints), allowing us to create
//different version of our website for different widths
